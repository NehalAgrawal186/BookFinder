# BookFinder
In the present scenario, we are dealing with the manual searching of book from thousands of other books present in Google Book API. 
With the help of this application we are able to find a place where we can easily find the book with the help of keywords. 
As soon as the user enters the app, there will be landing page containing the name of the app and then there will be a login /signup page .
Initially there will be search bar as shown in the image below. Then on the basis of certain keywords the app will fetch the results and the books will be displayed as shown in the second screenshot.
In this we will add a feature to bookmarks the book or add to favorites as this will be helpful when the user try the use the same book again

1.	A “Welcome Page (Splash Page)” which displays the logo and the name of the app.
